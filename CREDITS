Following in the steps of other open source projects that eventually take over
the world, here is the partial list of people who have contributed to
parrot-libgit2 and its supporting works.  It is sorted by name and formatted to
allow easy grepping and beautification by scripts.  The fields are: name (N),
email (E), web-address (W), description (D), main username (U), alias usernames
(pA) and snail-mail address (S).

    Thanks,

    The parrot-libgit2 Team
    PS: Yes, this looks remarkably like the Linux CREDITS format
